Segmentation model based on the implementation by IgorFreik (https://github.com/IgorFreik/Leaf_Counter_ComputerVision) modified to work with Hyperspectral images and coco-annotated images. 

The architecture of the model was originally taken from this paper: https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpls.2022.844522/full.
